This dataset contains preliminary spin resolution measurements of the electric field from the EFW experiment on the Cluster C3 spacecraft. These data have been converted into Cluster Exchange Format from the orignal Cluster Science Data System Common Data Format (CDF) Prime Parameter files that were made available through the Cluster Science Data System. The metadata has been updated from the CSDS/CDF standard to the CAA to aid compatibility with tools developed for the Cluster Active Archive.  Version 01 of this dataset is the initial translation prepared for the launch of the CAA during the second half of 2005

                The plots show the EFW electric field components against HIA electric field
                components in ISR2 coordinate system (pseudo-GSE). The three panels (top to
                bottom) show the comparison for x, y, and z components. For each panel, the
                black line shows 1:1 correspondence as a reference line. For the
                generation of data points the following procedure is implemented: For each HIA
                data point, it is searched if there is an EFW data point within +/-2 seconds
                (half a spin), and the value or the average (if more than one value exist) is taken as
